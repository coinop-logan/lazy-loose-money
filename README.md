It’s important to know what your goal is. **But it’s more important to know what it’ll take you to actually accomplish your goal.**

The possibility of losing money? A Referee who verifies your reports? Supporters who cheer you on along the way? Everyone’s different.

Stickk data shows that creating a Commitment Contract with:
* A Referee increases your chances of success by up to 2x
* Financial stakes increase your chances of success by up to 3x

What will it take for you?
